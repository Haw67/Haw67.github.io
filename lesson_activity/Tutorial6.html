                                Once honored defenders of Shurima against the Void,
                                Aatrox and his brethren would eventually become an even greater threat to Runeterra,
                                and were defeated only by cunning mortal sorcery.
                                But after centuries of imprisonment,
                                Aatrox was the first to find freedom once more, corrupting and transforming those foolish enough to try and wield the magical weapon that contained his essence.
                                Now, with stolen flesh, he walks Runeterra in a brutal approximation of his previous form, seeking an apocalyptic and long overdue vengeance.

                                Weaponized to operate outside the boundaries of the law,
                                Camille is the Principal Intelligencer of Clan Ferros—an elegant and elite agent who ensures the Piltover machine and its Zaunite underbelly runs smoothly.
                                Adaptable and precise, she views sloppy technique as an embarrassment that must be put to order.
                                With a mind as sharp as the blades she bears, Camille's pursuit of superiority through hextech body augmentation has left many to wonder if she is now more machine than woman.

                                The most feared duelist in all Valoran, Fiora is as renowned for her brusque manner and cunning mind as she is for the speed of her bluesteel rapier.
                                Born to House Laurent in the kingdom of Demacia, Fiora took control of the family from her father in the wake of a scandal that nearly destroyed them.
                                House Laurent's reputation was sundered, but Fiora bends her every effort to restore her family's honor and return them to their rightful place among the great and good of Demacia.

                                The Noxian occupation of Ionia produced many heroes, none more unlikely than young Irelia of Navori.
                                Trained in the ancient dances of her province, she adapted her art for war, using the graceful and carefully practised movements to levitate a host of deadly blades.
                                After proving herself as a fighter, she was thrust into the role of resistance leader and figurehead, and to this day remains dedicated to the preservation of her homeland.

                                An Ionian of deep resolve, Yasuo is an agile swordsman who wields the air itself against his enemies.
                                As a proud young man, he was falsely accused of murdering his master—unable to prove his innocence, he was forced to slay his own brother in self defense.
                                Even after his master's true killer was revealed, Yasuo still could not forgive himself for all he had done, and now wanders his homeland with only the wind to guide his blade.
